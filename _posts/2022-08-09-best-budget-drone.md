## 5. HOLLY STONE HS100

 the best ultra cheap budget drone on the market in 2022

 this model comes in the almost ready to fly mode which means you only have to attach the
propellers before flying this is the standard for many high quality drones with cameras in order to save space and packaging and protect sensitive equipment from damage during transport

for cost reasons

 the holy stone hs 100 doesn't have any thrust props like the meaning you have to put a screw on every designated engine section but don't fret the whole thing takes about one minute for each propeller and 



the direction of rotation of the propeller is also clearly indicated by a and b marks even on longer distances the signal remains strong if the battery reaches a critically low level and a battery warning appears to charge approximately 10 to 100 percent you need about four hours via usb connection with automatic launch


 the holy stone hs100 works really well the drone takes off slowly and stays in air about three feet
above the ground automatic height retention does its job well thanks to gps positioning in official tests

The hs100 photos are very goodl as single images have a resolution of 1280x7 1280x720 pixels just like videos the camera has an extremely wide angle lens with a field of view of 120 degrees
the camera itself is attached to a one axis card and shaft and can be moved vertically with the remote control and the price is very good




## 4. DJI MINI SC



the best value budget drone on the market in 2022 this model sports a set of folding arms to achieve maximum compactness therefore it has more or less the same dimensions as the
mini 2 introduced in 2020 and remains below the 250 gram mark


 it has a 12 megapixel camera that supports 4 000 by on the video side the mini sc ignores 4k just like the mavic mini one but can record up to 2.7 k at 30p or in full hd at 60p the drone has a propeller that
can be tilted vertically from negative 90 to 20 degrees


furthermore the device offers better stabilization and above all increased resistance to wind gusts compared to the mavic mini it can withstand impacts of 18 and 22 miles per hour without deviating from its trajectory in terms of performance the dji mini sc should also be as fast as the mini with a top speed of 29 miles per hour the battery


finally the theoretical maximum range is 1.25 miles the device communicates with the remote control via wi-fi on the control side the mini sc will work with the mini remote control equipped with a 2600 mah battery it has detachable joysticks for easy storage and provides the pilot with hd video feedback 




The drone sports quick shots modes that make it easier to improve the subject with automated camera movements this is how we find the dronie rocket circle and spiral modes the mini sc should fully satisfy you and allow you to take high quality photos or videos from the air













## 3. RYZE TECH HELLO



 ryze tech tello aims to achieve both by allowing you to control the drone using an app or an optional
telo is a small drone measuring only 6 by 6 by 1.3 inches it weighs just under registration most of the weight comes from the battery that slides inside the plastic body of the drone


The tello can be controlled in three ways via an app, remote control or through the scratch programming interface the telo app is free for ios and android devices it includes a touch screen interface to control the drone as well as view 


The camera image we're looking at an easy to use program and provides a good level of control for beginners and experienced maneuverable drone with surprising speed of 20 miles per hour in fast flight mode and it could stop and turn in about six feet the slowest speed mode limits this to a
more manageable eight miles per hour 


taking off is easy just place the drone on a flat surface press the take off button and slide your finger over the confirmation on the screen the drone then turns on the engines takes off and hovers about five feet above the ground

In the amp you can activate various fun flight modes 8d turn up and go 360 lap and bounce mode hd flips is an acrobatic mode where you move the controller on the screen and the drone rotates in one
the 360 mode captures video as the drone slowly rotates in place while circle captures a short video as the drone rotates around the target keeping the camera pointed at it


 there's no gps on this drone so you can't program a course and set the drone to follow you through
the smartphone app


 tele records 720p video at 1280x720 resolution and 5 megapixel photos at 25.92 by 1936 px both are clean and sharp with a good level of detail and bright natural colors the 1100 mah battery that powers the telo provided between three and five minutes of flight which is not much but for beginners quite enough good stuff a













## 2. DJI MAVIC MINI



which in our opinion is the best budget drone for enthusiasts with only half a pound of weight the drone weighs less than the minimum requirement of 0.55 pounds for certain drone laws around the world 


Aside from all the legal stuff the mavic mini is a drone that can easily be packed with you on
the go it runs fast and can set up a solid 2.7 k video camera with a 12 megapixel sensor with a full charge you can reach up to 30 minutes of flight it's one of the best these days



 The remote control is quite simple but the new dji fly app for your phone adds the most important information about flight navigation for your operations


Th battery hub is used to charge the batteries but when charged the hub can convert the energy stored in those cells into a usb power supply for your smartphone or other accessory 


The the dji mavic mini is equipped with a decent set of components including 12 megapixel camera a stabilized 3-axis gimbal and an antenna for connecting up to 2.5 miles with a remote control



 The batteries are removable for quick change and return to the air the drone records 2.7 k video at up to 30 frames per second or drops at 1080p at a maximum of 60 frames per second you need to insert a micro sd card to save your photos and videos the remote control connects to android or ios choose the cable you need for your micro usb or usb type c phone then install




 the dji fly app to get started the mavic mini produces photos and videos equal to the best smartphone cameras on the market right now, note that the mavic mini limits its video to
2.7 k recording to use extra pixels to stabilize the image















## 1. DJI MINI


This model has retained the compact and lightweight form of the mavic mini weighing just
8.78 ounces this allows the mini 2 to continue to circumvent federal aviation administration regulations that require drones weighing 8.8 ounces grams or more
to be registered 

While the mini 2 may look very similar to the previous mavic mini a lot is happening under the
hood making it an even more attractive option including new 4k shooting capabilities and the adoption of ocusync 2.0 transmission technology with aki sync 2.0 



The maximum transmission range of the mini 2 has been increased to 6.2 miles an increase of 150 percent compared to the mavic mini battery life has also been slightly improved and now reaches 31 minutes instead of 30 minutes these new more powerful and efficient 



Engines are also responsible for enabling the mini 2 to withstand crosswinds of up to 24 miles per hour another great addition to the mini 2 is that support for 4k 30fps videos at 100 megabytes per second has finally arrived dji also promotes four times zoom at 1080p three times zoom at 2.7 k 

In addition to saving photos in the required jpeg format raw is now supported the lightweight design made the mini 2 easy to pick up and take with you on the go as for the videos and photo quality there is nothing to complain about 




For this price the picture quality is roughly what you would expect from the included cmos
sensor but dji now gives you the ability to record jpeg plus raw which is a big plus the camera is stabilized by an excellent 3-axis card and shaft which was generally smooth in operation


Overall this device delivers top-notch performance at the best possible price quality ratio
