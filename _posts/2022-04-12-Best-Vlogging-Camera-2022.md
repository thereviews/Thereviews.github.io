 thet autofocus is definitely improved over the s1 series it is effective in most situations and is also decent in tracking subjects moving in a reasonably predictable way


since the s5 uses the same sensor as the s1 we already knew that the picture and video quality would probably be very good the images contain a lot of detail
as well as great colors and balanced exposures a set of 20 to ml is a graet optic to start with because the wide angle is wider than we usually see on most lenses


 the video quality is also excellent with very smooth and detailed images the image quality is exceptional which is perhaps the most important thing the camera body is also well designed with a meaningless ergonomic design a very good electronic viewfinder and a very welcome fully
articulated touch screen
