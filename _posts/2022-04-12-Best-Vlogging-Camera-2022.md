## 3. PASSONIC LUMIX S5


<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08FF55MV4?pd_rd_i=B08FF55MV4&pf_rd_p=7672bfb7-93b0-4322-b745-2104db09c4df&pf_rd_r=F4K6WDNH7BH27JTK788K&pd_rd_wg=K4i3n&pd_rd_w=rm8HT&pd_rd_r=dfa9e933-51cc-4341-b300-956486ab8c2c&linkCode=li3&tag=18640a-20&linkId=276ca5d705381e61e43db1c86dca5db4&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_il" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B08FF55MV4&Format=_SL250_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=18640a-20&language=en_US" ></a><img src="https://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=18640a-20&language=en_US&l=li3&o=1&a=B08FF55MV4" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />


The best premium vlogging camera on the market, a key advantage of mirrorless cameras is their smaller size and lighter weight compared to the dslr models


 For the panasonic lumix s5 the manufacturers managed to fit everything into a body that is actually smaller than the panasonic gh5 a much smaller model with a much smaller sensor impressive by default 


The s5 comes with a 20 to 60 millimeter kit lens which can be folded and fits well with a small camera size at the heart of .panasonic lumix s5  

The S5 is a 24.2 megapixel sensor the same one found in its sibling the s1 placing a proven sensor in this smaller cheaper case is a smart move the s5 screen is fully
articulated and touch sensitive.

With 10 bit recording is available internally but you must restart the video after 30 minutes alternatively you can record an unlimited number of clips in 8k v-log recording is also available with 14 dynamic range stops also included in the mix are such cool specs as dual origin iso 4k anamorphic and timed recording


Thet autofocus is definitely improved over the s1 series it is effective in most situations and is also decent in tracking subjects moving in a reasonably predictable way


Since the s5 uses the same sensor as the s1 we already knew that the picture and video quality would probably be very good the images contain a lot of detail
as well as great colors and balanced exposures a set of 20 to ml is a graet optic to start with because the wide angle is wider than we usually see on most lenses


 The video quality is also excellent with very smooth and detailed images the image quality is exceptional which is perhaps the most important thing the camera body is also well designed with a meaningless ergonomic design a very good electronic viewfinder and a very welcome fully
articulated touch screen

includes 4k shooting mode and a front screen for vloggers


This camera is available in addition to the fujifilmcamera system and a particularly attractive option for enthusiasts the front and rear control wheels are used to control exposure


The design of the camera is one of the best as the trigger is slightly tilted forward and the on off switch surrounds it and there is another control wheel on the left next to the switch that opens the pop-up flash you

You can go through different aspects of in-camera movies a useful tool if you want to quickly switch from one creative style to another

 Tracking the subject is top notch when the camera is attached to the subject it does not lose its trace which is an advantage for photographers who capture sports action or unpredictable wild animals 


This model stands out thanks to the body image stabilization feature the sensor is mounted on a 5-axis stabilization system where image quality at higher iso ratings is on par with the best models overall this product delivers premium performance great looks and high durability
