On this review for the best vlogging camera we will take you a journey to explore the camera for vlogging in 2022 looking at it on different angels like price performence and different skill levels so no matter which you are looking for we got you covered 

   
### 1. <a href="https://amzn.to/3M6McPT">dji pocket 2K </a>

5.dji pocket 2

the best portable vlogging camera

available on the market in 2022 we're

looking at an off-road camera with a

compact size excellent stabilization and

top-notch photo and video quality not

much has changed compared to the first

generation but dji pocket 2 is improved

where its predecessor lagged behind auto

focus battery autonomy and microphones

this model's handling is comfortable

with a well responsive touch screen and

some well executed movements



in to that addition

the fact that you now have a joystick to

control zoom or camera movement makes

the device much more intuitive and if

the device itself doesn't suit you you

can always connect the dji pocket to

your smartphone with the included

adapters to use it you'll need to

download the dji memo app and connect

the device to usbc or lighting port on

your smartphone as for the quality of

shooting and photography it is very impressive

 it's true that we'll not reach the

levels of a more professional slr camera

but we can expect quality similar to

that we have with some compact cameras

iphone 12 pro or samsung galaxy note 20

ultra the fact that this is a camera

with a clean and simple gimbal helps a

lot to keep the quality solid especially

in low lighting dji pocket 2 can take

photos with a maximum resolution of 64

the optics have also changed the viewing

angle is now 93 degrees instead of 80

which is crucial for selfie mode from a

distance of one hand we can easily

capture the whole face and many

landscapes depending on the selected

resolution of the photo or video we can

zoom from four times to eight times also

vloggers will be interested in how the

device manages speech with one hand the

microphone gain level is sufficient all

in all it'll satisfy everyone not just

vloggers it gives you better results

than a smartphone and still fits in your

pocket

### 2. <a href="https://amzn.to/37I1P16">Passonic Lumix G100</a>

4.the canon eos m50 mark ii the

best budget vlogging camera on the

market in 2022 this model comes with

several enhancements and features

specifically designed for use on social

media and content creation it's

basically a revamped version of canon's

earlier m50 mark 1. 


the features of the

mark ii remain quite similar to its

predecessor with a 24.1 megapixel cmos

sensor and a digic 8 image processor

that allows the camera to record 4k

video at 24 frames per second in short

the update includes better auto focus

for both photos and videos allowing you

to accurately track moving subjects

within the frame the device can be

easily used as a webcam thanks to the

free canon eos webcam utility software

which comes with youtube live wireless

streaming capabilities and a handy

built-in timer the device is quite an

interesting feature regarding the

tilting screen which makes vertical

video recording more intuitive and

enjoyable without the need for further

editing and cutting furthermore

 the m50 mark ii comes with a clear hdmi output

so you can record to an external voice

recorder or monitor on a larger screen

the rear screen is a standard 3-inch

screen with 1.04 megapixels with support

for touch input


 the eos m50 has shown

that this is a great camera even for

some serious professional applications

also if you think autofocus is key to

your content then you should choose the

mark ii for the listed price we are

thoroughly impressed

### 3. <a href="https://amzn.to/3KElfCx"> Panasonic Lumix FZ300 </a>
3.panasonic lumix s5 

the best premium vlogging camera on the market in

2022 a key advantage of mirrorless

cameras is their smaller size and

lighter weight compared to the dslr

models for the panasonic lumix s5 the

manufacturers managed to fit everything

into a body that is actually smaller

than the panasonic gh5 a much smaller

model with a much smaller sensor

impressive by default the s5 comes with

a 20 to 60 millimeter kit lens which can

be folded and fits well with a small

camera size at the heart of the s5 is a

24.2 megapixel sensor the same one found

in its sibling the s1 placing a proven

sensor in this smaller cheaper case is a

smart move the s5 screen is fully

articulated and touch sensitive you can

shoot 4k at 60p i'll bite with clipped

applied or 30p without it 10 bit

recording is available internally but

you must restart the video after 30

minutes alternatively you can record an

unlimited number of clips in 8k v-log

recording is also available with 14

dynamic range stops also included in the

mix are such cool specs as dual origin

iso 4k anamorphic and timed recording

the good news is that autofocus is

definitely improved over the s1 series

it is effective in most situations and

is also decent in tracking subjects

moving in a reasonably predictable way



since the s5 uses the same sensor as the

s1 we already knew that the picture and

video quality would probably be very

good the images contain a lot of detail

as well as great colors and balanced

exposures a set of 20 to 60 millimeter

lenses is a great optic to start with

because the wide angle is wider than we

usually see on most lenses the video

quality is also excellent with very

smooth and detailed images the image

quality is exceptional which is perhaps

the most important thing the camera body

is also well designed with a meaningless

ergonomic design a very good electronic

viewfinder and a very welcome fully

articulated touch screen

### 4. <a href="https://amzn.to/3uD4get"> sony zv1 </a>

  best vlogging camera available

on the market in 2022 this model is

designed to make life easier for content

creators making youtube clips thanks to

predefined modes preserving some details

of construction and usability this is a

magnificent option an outstanding

picture quality combined with good sound

quality this camera allows us to blur

the backgrounds as much as possible by

focusing the attention on the subject to

your liking similarly with the same

button we can focus on objects in the

it's noticeable that this device is

intended for content creators in terms

of design and construction we're looking

at a solid compact design with good

ergonomics whether we hold the camera

behind or in front the fact that it has

a micro usb port at the moment is not so

positive as a usbc port would definitely

be more desirable the device also

includes an hdmi port and a microphone

input we like the image quality both in

good lighting conditions and in backlit



whatever content you create a massive

three inch folding rear screen will be

your perfect ally to see every shot

perfectly this camera with 20 megapixels

and an equivalent focal length of 24 to

70 millimeters has an optical zoom which

speed can be adjusted from one of the

full hd and 4k resolution and even has

the sound is taken care of by the top

microphone which delivers a pretty

decent result in the connectivity

department this camera has bluetooth and

wifi connection which makes it super

easy to control it from a smartphone if

we're talking about autonomy it remains

on about 250 photos an aspect that we

believe could be improved
