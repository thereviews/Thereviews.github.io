## NIKON Z6



best mirrorless travel camera on the market in 2022 the manufacturer gave the whole configuration an upgrade and we now get digital images of 20.9 million effective pixels or 4k videos,  nikon has also introduced a new 16 to 50 millimeter zoom lens and silver to Complement




 this model's retro style it can be purchased separately or with a camera the seductive retro vibe with the tactile buttons levers and wheels is truly special while newcomers may initially be stunned by the three hand wheels on the top panel that control shutter speed exposure , compensation and iso sensitivity you'll get accustomed to the new system easily




the lcd screen variable with tilt angleis also useful and the touch screen allows you to capture images by simply touching the desired subject on the screen just like on a typical dslr ,  the on off switch ergonomically surrounds the shutter release button so we could get started quickly the colors 






This model delivers the best image quality without being unnatural also there are pleasant out of  and sharp subjects with zoom provided however the exposure can be easily and quickly reduced if necessary via the exposure compensation wheel on the top Plate




 the iso 100 of 51200 range will allow you to shoot by hand without flash in most situations avoiding camera shake and image blur




 the device features touch tracking auto focus on a subject locked screen and zfc detects faces and eyes with reasonable speed precision and Reliability,  high speed action sequences can be shot at up to 11 frames per second in perfect extended mode with progressive auto focus and auto exposure




the nikon z6 is a compact 20.9 megapixel aps-c camera unlike nikon's previous model which took dslr and removed features in the name of its retro reconstruction the fc is not at all distracting ,  it can take full resolution photos of up to 11 frames per second and 4k video at 30fps for up to 30 minutes at a time good stuff








## SONY ZV1





 the best vlogging travel camera on the market in 2022 this powerful compact and functional camera offers all the tools you need whether you're just starting a vlog or you're an experienced professional who needs a few additional tools



 the design is minimal made of black plastic with a subtle texture also sony set up a suitable touch screen on this video focused camera much better than the ones that roll over on top of the camera 



For professional users who want to record sound from a dedicated microphone the manufacturer has included a three and a half millimeter port on the right just above the micro usb and mini hdmi ports





the zv1 has a sony bionzx image processor the great thing about sensors that it puts the camera in intelligent automatic or automatic movie shooting mode and it'll usually quickly detect what's happening in the scene and adjust the settings to suit it




 Another important feature is the instant background blur mode ,  looking at the lens mechanism when you press the dedicated mode button we see that the zv1 mechanically switches to a wider Aperture



 when it comes to auto tracking and autofocus it's as fast and accurate as any of sony's modern cameras mainly thanks to the one inch sensor that offers both phase detection points on its surface





e sony's extra effort in the zv1 was to introduce a built-in microphone system that's good enough to accessories and for the most part that effort paid off as the video recording and speech to the camera gives clear loud Sound





 the zv1 achieves a top speed of 30 frames per second when set to full resolution but can shoot up to 60 frames per second in 1080p perhaps the only thing that makes it less versatile as a camera is the zoom length it is only three times optical zoom equivalent to 24 to 70 millimeters which is not so versatile in that respect overall this is a quality product









## PASSONIC ZS200




the best compact travel camera available on the market in 2022 like the previous model it's equipped with a large sensor offering a resolution of 20 megapixels capable of recording 4k videos the zoom lens has been extended to telephoto range now zooming in at 15 times



additionally the viewfinder and touch screen have a higher resolution while the optical image stabilizer is of course still on board with the new linear focus drive engine panasonic wants to speed up the already fast autofocus even more  






The sensor works at 240 frames per second and the screen is of course touch sensitive the resolution  on the other hand has been increased from 1.04 to 2.23 million pixels the electronic viewfinder has magnification went up from 1.24 times to 1.45 times

 the stereo microphone is located on top of the camera and even in videographer has complete control over the exposure features for 4k videos are also on board and an integrated vlan for wireless image transfer and remote camera control via the app is now complemented by bluetooth for a permanent connection to the smartphone






the three inch touchscreen monitor is located on the back unfortunately the monitor cannot be moved which makes using the camera from a frog and bird's eye view more challenging 
the precision of the touch function is very high and therefore the use and practice is pleasantly simple fast and safe





 the two physical connections of the camera on the right side under the plastic cover in detail there's a micro hdmi interface and a micro usb connector as for the battery it has 1025 mah and 7.2 volts it should provide enough power for 370 Exposures

system the 20 megapixel is a welcome addition and an important step over


The predecessor's 16 megapixel sensor but the first thing that strikes you about the em-104 is its small size it's small enough to fit in your pocket even with the lens attached 





the lcd touch screen is the most ambitious in this series so far this time the screen tilts up to 90 degrees to shoot at hip height and tilts down 180 degrees in the other direction





the oled viewfinder remains unchanged from the previous model and offers a clear view of the scene in front with layered settings which means that once you're familiar with the design you no longer have to look away from the viewfinder to make adjustments
